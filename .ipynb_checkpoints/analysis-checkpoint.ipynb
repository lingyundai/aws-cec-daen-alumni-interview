      "Atabak Mardan   9:26\n",

      "Understanding data and data wrangling, so I would say from there also I learned SQL from my courses from university, but I never had had an like an opportunity to work with them until my last job.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   10:31\n",

      "Programming, let's say scripting programming.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Atabak Mardan   11:08\n",
      "So I would say more Python code oriented courses rather than R.\n",

      "I was back in 2019.\n",
      "It's my answers already. It's respective so.\n",

      "Lingyun Dai   11:57\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "OK, sounds good.\n",

      "\n",
      "Atabak Mardan   12:34\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Lack of that cloud based courses was the main suffering point. Even after my graduation.\n",
      "I I failed to land a job in data analytics or data science because.\n",
      "Of that problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   12:55\n",
      "K.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "The last question is, have you completed any courses certification since you graduated from the DNEN program?\n",
      "\n",
      "Atabak Mardan   13:08\n",
      "Not anything big and like.\n",
      "Mention barsi. I'm doing some LinkedIn learnings and other stuff, but.\n",

      "It put pieces together.\n",
      "It was like I had some material to do something, but I didn't know how to use them.\n",
      "But that Capstone project, especially our project was working with the outside.\n",
      "Company a power like a electricity company.\n",
      "So, like going interviewing them, understanding what client want, understanding what they need and translating their needs into the data product.\n",
      "That's one thing.\n",
      "I mean, data scientists should understand and know on top of all of the other like coding and like a cloud skills.\n",

      "So my day-to-day work involves like most of the time is creating ML OPS, machine learning operations platform and some analytics.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Which involves like we get this problem definition from our partner teams.\n",

      "Or an business team.\n",
      "So if the data science team they come up with this requirement of like getting a pipeline into production are transitioning their.\n",
      "Poc.\n",

      "8 into production, so there are multiple phases here.\n",

      "So I used to take less linear programming course.\n",
      "So which is?\n",
      "I think it's in first semester and I took an advanced course under Dr. C.\n",

      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   7:33\n",
      "So that knowledge helped me out in like contributing to the team in solving that resource allocation problem.\n",
      "So that's the data science part of it, like helping them to formulate the problem and then giving them a methodology so that they can implement on their systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   7:52\n",
      "OK.\n",

      "So what would you say are the most used technologies in your career, like programming, language framework, cloud machine learning?\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   8:50\n",
      "Yeah, most used.\n",
      "I've used lot of Python programming.\n",
      "And.\n",
      "Linear programming concepts that I've learned.\n",
      "And next is I used.\n",

      "OK.\n",

      "OK.\n",
      "So the next one is.\n",
      "Word knowledge or skills that you acquire in the daem program that have been the most valuable to your career. If you can specify the concepts, technologies that were the most valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   11:24\n",
      "Yes. So the concept is I got this.\n",
      "1st is Robi.\n",
      "So this is for from practical optimization or 604 I think.\n",
      "So that's the course.\n",
      "That added most value and there is this statistics stat 515.\n",
      "Basic understanding of.\n",
      "L type course.\n",
      "Or 604.\n",
      "Stat 515.\n",
      "So one is more focused towards visualizations and the other one is towards operational research and linear programming.\n",
      "And.\n",
      "What else did I go through?\n",
      "These are the two courses that I remember, and also I've learned this database principles.\n",
      "Like Professor Baldo taught as that.\n",
      "That helped me a lot, like in defining tables and how do I like define features for in machine learning mod?\n",
      "That is one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   12:50\n",
      "Sounds good. So.\n",
      "What specific courses, topics or training that you think?\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   12:59\n",
      "Mm hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   13:01\n",

      "sri ram sagar k   13:04\n",
      "Mm hmm.\n",
      "What topics?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   13:11\n",
      "So what?\n",
      "What do you think?\n",
      "Specific courses, topics or training OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   13:15\n",
      "At at at my current like. Obviously, technology and time shifts right and changes.\n",
      "At current scenario, more emphasis on ML operations like.\n",
      "Getting the models into production and as well as maintaining infrastructure around the models.\n",
      "And like monitoring, monitoring models and monitoring features, how do we scale the pipelines faster?\n",
      "So that has changed drastically. I.\n",
      "I mean, six years back there used to be this big data Hadoop wave at that time that is relevant whatever I learned.\n",
      "But now it's more of using cloud infra as well as.\n",
      "Security security like using proper security standards in these ML operation pipelines that become that is becoming more prevalent.\n",
      "Like, how do we?\n",
      "Do authentications minimum authentications?\n",
      "How do you we use those authentications in machine learning pipelines that kind of knowledge if Dan can like incorporate in their course then that will be really valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   14:41\n",
      "That sounds really good. OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   14:45\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   14:45\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "So overall, how well do you think the DAU and course's prepared you for your career?\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   14:57\n",
      "8829.\n",
      "\n",

      "Sorry, from scale one to five, one is not well at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   15:02\n",
      "Because I want to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   15:03\n",
      "Five is very good. Yeah, sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   15:07\n",
      "I I give it around 3.5 to 4:00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   15:13\n",
      "What do you think is lacking?\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   15:17\n",
      "So.\n",
      "I.\n",
      "I know we have this DA in project.\n",
      "That actually happens at the end of the semester.\n",
      "So when I was like, I was like.\n",
      "I'm an international student, so the limitations that I have is when I start my course I'll have lot of time but I won't think about selling my project that I do at the end DA in 690.\n",
      "That happens.\n",
      "Usually we take at the final semester.\n",
      "If there is some kind of, you know, push or some kind of guidance saying that.\n",
      "We have to plan our daen project.\n",
      "Even before we start that semester, that should happen. Maybe in second semester or so.\n",
      "The actual planning like.\n",
      "Any project in like that I do in work it easily take six months.\n",
      "Because of a sur if we can somehow give some kind of guidelines, extra guidelines saying that you'll have something in the, I mean we get these guidelines initially when we start in first semester say saying that there will be a DA in project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   16:16\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   16:31\n",
      "But as a student, I won't have the experience to plan my milestones. Saying that I have a super DA in project which is more valuable to the organization that I'm like.\n",
      "Studying like GMU.\n",
      "So if I can somehow plan it in advance and have a proper Maidstone for every semester, then at the end that'll add value to my career as well as GMU. Like if I have like some concrete project that I was working for one 1 1/2 year.\n",
      "Then I have that at the end like final semester so I can even remote it to a bigger audience so it can it could become a paper or something else.\n",
      "That let that will be like helping both of us. I mean here the both parties being me as a student as well as Dan program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   17:25\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So you you're basically saying that if they the project can start early, can be like a long term thing that covers a couple semesters so that you can have a bigger project to add more values. OK, gotcha.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   17:26\n",
      "So that's 1/3.\n",
      "Yes, yes. And it'll also train me like project when we go into job.\n",
      "That's different.\n",
      "But when we do in a course that is different.\n",
      "Course we work only on the outcomes, like OK.\n",
      "There is a model.\n",
      "How do I build that model and how do I like get get a result out of it, but when we transition to company it's different we'll we'll be working with different teams and also we'll be trying to actually formulate a problem and then solve it.\n",
      "That we cannot do it in like 3 months course plan sitting like like. So that's what that is my feeling.\n",
      "Maybe if we start early on.\n",
      "And have some guidance from Professor so that he give me lot of time to interact with professors and get their guidelines guide saying that OK this is what I want to do and if I if I can do that early on around two second semester or like.\n",
      "3rd semester around second semester I prefer at around second semester that you give me an opportunity to discuss all my ideas, right? And then professors will help me to guard rail saying that OK this is the scope that you can do and even though it can be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   18:51\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   18:59\n",
      "Faster.\n",
      "It'll help me to improve on it like I can get that project in like third semester but on 4th semester I can actually like refine it and make it more presentable and get it which will add true value to like actual community.\n",
      "Something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   19:18\n",
      "Yeah. OK.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   19:19\n",
      "So my suggestion would be having one point.\n",
      "Someone. What is that .1 credit? Something like one.\n",
      "Credit one credit, one credit. Instead of having DA in as a three credit thing at the final semester.\n",
      "It's like focus on like initial topics that we usually skip like planning.\n",
      "How do you plan a project?\n",
      "It it's we cannot do it like, just like we're sitting in a week and saying that I'll do this project within like two months.\n",
      "That kind of it's more like like doing project is second thing actually experiencing the like process a convention of doing a project is a different thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   19:56\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   20:06\n",
      "So providing that experience from Semester 2 would give lot of value to black students.\n",
      "So that's what I I missed, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   20:16\n",
      "OK, OK.\n",
      "Sounds good.\n",
      "Thank you so much.\n",

      "So have you completed any courses certifications since you graduated from the program?\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   20:29\n",
      "Certifications haven't taken any certification, but I occasionally do these LinkedIn courses and courses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   20:38\n",
      "On what kind of topic?\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   20:44\n",
      "Oh, on topics like recently I did one course on communication team communication.\n",
      "How to talk to people how to like get our idea so that like we, we need to work with people right in order to get this project going on.\n",
      "So how do we do that?\n",
      "How do we promote our idea and get?\n",
      "An it's more like a project management thing.\n",
      "How do I promote my idea?\n",
      "Get it? Like thumbs up from other people. And then so that when once everybody's onboard, how do we plan it into phases?\n",
      "Phase one.\n",
      "So this is the input that I'm trying to get it in phase one and what would be the output of phase one?\n",
      "How do I iterate it on phase two?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   21:32\n",
      "OK. Other.\n",
      "\n",
      "sri ram sagar k   21:32\n",
      "So that's one course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lingyun Dai   21:35\n",
      "Do you have other courses that you completed?\n",
      "Like on what kind of topics?\n",
